Esrap-PEG is a thin wrapper on top of Esrap that uses Esrap to 
parse PEG grammars and can use the resulting AST to define rules
for an Esrap parser that parses the PEG grammar in question.

See http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/popl04/peg-popl04.pdf
and http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/ for more information.

I use the canonical PEG definition with two exceptions. First,
I allow octal escape \377 (original article says [0-2] for the
first digit for some reason). Second, I allow \u followed by
4 hexadecimal digits for full Unicode escape.

The library provides means to parse PEG syntax, to define rules
in run-time without compiling any closures and to generate code
that implements the rules in compiled module.

It does a walk around the tree to define rules or to return code
defining the rules.

This parser uses the same permissive license as Esrap.
